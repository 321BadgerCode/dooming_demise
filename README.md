# Dooming Demise

## Summary

The python program uses the average age of death to approximate when you will die and what percent of life you have lived, assuming you live around the average lifespan.

## Usage

```sh
python ./main.py
```

## TODO

- [ ] Take in other factors such as drinks, smokes, bmi to determine healthy factor and weight to better approximate when they will die
- [ ] More factors such as how much of a risk taker (determined based on survey) to put into neural network that will see likelihood of freak accident minimizing expected lifespan
